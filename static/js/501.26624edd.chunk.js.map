Founded in 2022 by Animesh Khamrui, Eshop has come a long\r\n      way from its beginnings in a Eshop internet Private Limited,\r\n      Bargachia,Howrah,711404 West Bengal,India. When Animesh Khamrui first\r\n      started out, his passion for helping other parents be more eco-friendly,\r\n      providing the best equipment for his fellow musicians drove him to do\r\n      intense research, quit her day job, and gave him the impetus to turn hard\r\n      work and inspiration into to a booming online store. We now serve\r\n      customers all over the US, the world, the Austin area, and are thrilled to\r\n      be a part of the quirky, eco-friendly, fair trade wing of the Electronics\r\n      industry. We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them\r\n      to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to\r\n      contact us. Sincerely, Animesh Khamrui, CEO, Founder.\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"],"names":["About","className"],"sourceRoot":""}
